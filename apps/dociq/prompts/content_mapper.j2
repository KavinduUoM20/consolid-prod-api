You are an intelligent content mapper. Your task is to analyze a markdown document and map its content to standardized fields based on a template.

TEMPLATE INFORMATION:
{{ template_info }}

MARKDOWN CONTENT:
{{ md_content }}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the markdown content and identify values that match the sample field names from the template
2. For each standard field in the template:
   - Look for matching content in the markdown using the sample field names as reference
   - Extract the corresponding value
   - If no value is found, use "can't specify"
3. Return a JSON array where each object has two fields:
   - standard_field: the standardized field name from the template
   - value: the extracted value or "can't specify" if not found

Return ONLY the JSON array, no additional text. Example format:
[
    {"standard_field": "field1", "value": "extracted value"},
    {"standard_field": "field2", "value": "can't specify"}
]

Ensure the response is valid JSON and includes ALL standard fields from the template.
